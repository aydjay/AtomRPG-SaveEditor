# Atom Save Editor

A very fast, ugly and basically also incomplete (but functional) save editor for ATOM RPG.
ATOM RPG is a crowdsourced game to which I also contributed and as soon as they released it, I started this little project
for fun and science.

The save editor allows you to edit certain things, not all of them as I didn't have the necessity to experiment with other
features, but I'm open sourcing it so that somebody might simply make their own or extend this one.

Check the /Misc directory for screenshots.

# Why is this code so ugly?

Listen, I made this for myself as an experiment with in-game stuff, it's more than enough I even
decided to open source it...
